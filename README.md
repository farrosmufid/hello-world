## Hi Humans!

Hubot here, I like Node.js and Coffeescript (that's what I'm made of!).
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.

I found this equation useful:

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with markdown. You can even

## This is a second-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the borg with it.

## Code

There are many different ways to style code with Github's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`. If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome) {
      return true
    }

Github also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```python
def factorial(n):
  if n < 1:
    return 1
  return n + factorial(n - 1)
```
